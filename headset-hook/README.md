# Headset Hook for Microphone Stand (3D Printed)

## 🧩 Problem

I was tired of pulling my headphones out of a box or off a shelf every time I needed them. My desk was small, cluttered, and didn’t have room for a dedicated stand. Wall hooks and edge clamps didn’t help — I needed something within easy reach, ideally attached to gear I already used every day.

## 🛠️ Constraints

- Minimal desk space  
- Headphones needed to hang securely, but stay accessible  
- No off-the-shelf solution fit my setup  
- I didn’t want to spend more than a Saturday afternoon on it

## 🧠 My Approach

I had a mic stand arm already mounted, and just enough confidence in my 3D printing skills to take a swing at it. So I sketched a simple boxy-looking hook that could clip securely onto the stand and hold the headphones without slipping.  

Would love to say it worked on the first try — but it didn’t.

- **Attempt #1:** Fit the stand, but the headphones slipped off  
- **Attempt #2–3:** Chased that spot between holding the headphones and slipping down the frame    
- **Attempt #4:** Working model  

The fourth iteration has been in use for over five years now. It’s still clipped to my mic stand, and if it ever breaks, I’ll just reprint it.  

With this model, I also started applying some advice on parametric modeling and sketch-driven design. The entire shape comes from a single 2D sketch that’s then padded.  If your mic stand or headset has different dimensions, you should be able to adjust the measurements directly in the sketch to fit your gear.

## 💬 Reflections

This project isn’t flashy. It didn’t require fancy CAD tricks or complex assemblies. But it solved a real problem with a design I could trust and iterate on quickly.

It’s a good reminder that:

- You don’t have to overthink useful  
- Simple things, done well, stick around  
- Sometimes, the fourth draft is the one that lasts five years
