# Rob Bills: Maker Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my collection of practical, real-world engineering fixes, custom solutions, and experimental builds. Most of these were designed to solve problems around the home, in the workshop, or on the track field â€” using FreeCAD, 3D printers, a well-seasoned cast iron pan, and a stubborn desire to make things work better.
