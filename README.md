# Rob Bills: Maker Projects Portfolio  

Welcome to my collection of practical, real-world engineering fixes, custom solutions, and experimental builds. Most of these were designed to solve problems around the home, in the workshop, or on the track field, mostly using FreeCAD, 3D printers, and a stubborn desire to figure out solutions to my own problems.

## ðŸ”§ Projects
