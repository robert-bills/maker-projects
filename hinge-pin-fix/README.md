# Storm Door Hinge Pin Fix

When high winds snapped the hinge pin on my storm door, I started searching for replacement parts. The only in-stock option was a $35 kit, that would arrive in a brief 3 weeks. The cheaper universal option? Sold out. And made of ABS.

That’s when I remembered: I have resin.

## 🔧 The Problem

- Storm door hinge pin snapped in high winds  
- No affordable or in-stock replacement available  
- Needed a durable, custom-fit fix that didn’t break the bank  

## 🧠 The Idea

With a resin printer, FreeCAD, and an adjustable wrench as my only measuring tool, I decided to model the hinge pin myself.

> ⚠️ No calipers were harmed in the making of this repair.

## 🖥️ CAD and Print

- Modeled the original pin dimensions using FreeCAD
- Printed a test pin in resin — slight tweaks to get the tolerance just right
- Used a surviving original pin and spacer to check fit
- Printed a second set — clean fit, no sanding needed

## 🛠️ Install

The pin dropped right into place. The door is now operating like new. And bonus: no creaking, no misalignment.

## 🎉 Outcome

- Total cost: ~30¢ in resin and one hour of modeling
- Print time: I used the defaults on my Halot Mage. Print was 2 hours, 45 minutes
- Total satisfaction: Extremely high  
- Future proofing: Files are shareable for others with the same problem

## 🗂️ Files

- `/stl/hinge-pin.stl` – Final export
- `/images/` – Photos of the hinge, print, and install
- `/source/hinge-pin.FCStd` – FreeCAD source file
