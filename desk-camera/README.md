# Camera Mount – Eye-Level and Rock Solid

I got tired of looking up at a webcam mounted on top of my monitor—or worse, looking down at it perched on a cardboard box. I wanted something simple, stable, and at *my* eye level.

This camera mount grew out of that need. It attaches directly to the pole of my dual-monitor stand, keeping the camera right where I want it without taking up desk space or needing constant adjustment.

## 🧰 The Build

- Mounts securely to a vertical pole (mine’s part of a monitor arm setup)
- Articulated with a rigid platform that holds the camera steady
- 1/4"-20 camera mounting screw added in the latest iteration
- Originally printed in ABS on a QIDI X-Maker, now in ABS-like resin on a Halot Mage
- Been rock solid for over a year with zero creep or drift

## 🛠️ Parts & Files

You'll find:
- STL files for each component
- A `.FCStd` FreeCAD source file with all four parts in one project

Bring your own junk drawer screws—threaded inserts and custom bolts are for another day.

## 📏 Design Evolution

The original version used mounting tape to hold the webcam in place (it worked, but it was… inelegant). The latest design features a proper screw mount for standard webcams or cameras, making it easy to remove or reposition the rig without compromising stability.

## 🔧 What I'd Change If I Do It Again

- Thread the clamp holes so I can use machine screws directly (no nuts)
- Slightly re-angle the arm for improved adjustability
- Maybe integrate cable routing clips (but that’s just getting fancy)

## 🤝 Want to Use It?

Go for it. Adapt, remix, improve.  
Let me know how it works for you—or better yet, show me your version.
