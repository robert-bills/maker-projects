# Cinder Block Smoker (w/ Dakota Fire Pit Assist)

This is my low-budget, high-output backyard smoker—built primarily from standard cinder blocks and scrap steel grating. It’s modular, scalable, and has one job: to slow-cook with *serious* smoke flavor.

## Background

I needed a large-capacity smoker that didn’t cost a fortune. Commercial models were either too small or too expensive, so I improvised—literally brick by brick.

Since the initial build, I have upgraded the heat source to a Dakota Fire Pit beneath the cooking chamber (not pictured) to generate steady airflow and efficient combustion. That fire pit channels heat through a firebox built inside the smoker structure, which then circulates smoke and warmth through the cooking chamber.

## Materials Used

- Standard cinder blocks (stacked dry, no mortar)
- Expanded steel grating (used as cooking racks and fire grates)
- Scrap sheet metal for the lid
- An old digital thermometer
- Optional: fire bricks lining the bottom chamber

## Features

- **Modular:** Entire unit is dry-stacked, so it can be disassembled and moved easily.
- **Efficient:** Uses the Dakota Fire Pit for low fuel consumption and high heat retention.
- **Capacity:** Can handle four ten-pound pork shoulders or two full racks of ribs.
- **Thermal Stability:** Holds heat like a champ once the firebox gets rolling.
- **Total Cost:** Less than $200 (sale on cinder blocks that week!)

## Final Thoughts

This build has served multiple family cookouts and could feed about four families at full capacity. It’s surprisingly stable, and—best of all, entirely off-grid. If you’ve got some blocks, some grating, and an appetite, you can build one too.

*Note: Always use a fire-safe surface and monitor closely. Even redneck engineering should be done responsibly.*
