# First Act Guitar: 3D Printed Bridge and Tuner Repair

This project documents a functional, lightweight restoration of an older First Act acoustic guitar with no available replacement parts. While the instrument isnâ€™t high-end, it plays decentlyâ€”and with a few tweaks, it was worth keeping in rotation.

## ðŸ”§ The Problem

- The bridge plate had cracked and pulled away.
- String action was inconsistent and saddle retention was poor.
- Tuner post holes were wallowed out, causing string instability.
- Replacement parts for this model were discontinued or never available.

## ðŸ§  The Fix

Using FreeCAD and a filament printer, I designed and printed:

- A new **bridge plate** with screw retention holes.
- A **saddle retainer** to hold the original saddle in place and stabilize the string height.
- **Tuner post spacers** (or washers) to keep the strings from wandering or binding due to oversize holes.

These parts were printed in standard filament and have held up under regular tuning and playing for over two years.

## ðŸ§ª Lessons Learned

- filament prints can hold up surprisingly well under moderate mechanical stressâ€”especially with good curing and conservative tolerances.
- Designing to reuse as many original components as possible makes retrofits cleaner and more stable.
- Even budget guitars can be fun and satisfying to fix.
